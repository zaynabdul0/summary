        <h1>Zay's Husband</h1><hr>
        <h2>Before then, meet Zay!</h2>
       <p>My name is Zainab Abdulkareem, the first of five children from Benue State but based in Lagos. I am 20 years old, in my third year in uni.
        I currently major in Computer science and I have interest in writing, cooking, designing, beauty, fashion, and web development.
        I have done a few spoken word poetry, debates and news casting, while in secondary school. It is indeed a passion I hope to pursue later on, if time permits.
        One of my favorite things to do is scroll through pinterest for ideas. My favorite color is purple. 
        I am a vessel of Christ, a devoted lover and follower also. One day I hope to create a faith-based podcast so I can just yap away about my love for Christ and hopefully inspire others.
       </p><br>
       <p>I could go on and on about the things I like but here are a few of things I did this year that I think are necessary for my story
        <ol>
            <li>I went to the beach for the first time and I realized how much I loved it there. </li>
            <li>I started learning to love myself more, starting from:
                <ul>
                    <li>Loving my stomach</li>
                    <li>Not complaining about the things that are wrong about me</li>
                    <li>Giving myself grace to stand up after a fall</li>
                    <li>Not forcing myself to love the things I used to love</li>
                    <li>Understanding that friendships die and that's not okay but you have to move on</li>
                    <li>Allowing myslf rest</li>
                    <li>Understanding that not having something the moment you want it doesn't mean you'll never have it.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>I have gone out and explored more places, food and people.</li>
            <li>I partly understood the essense of journalling</li>
            <li>I got into a very healthy relationship</li>
            <li>I got gifted a lot of times and that made me so happy.</li>
            <li>I took my programming serious</li>
            <li>I became more grateful for the little things</li>
            <li>I loved my family more</li>
            <li>I realized how much I love travelling </li>
        </ol>
       </p>

    <p>While all of this seem unneccesary to you, I don't care because it's my story and not yours.
        When e reach your turn, write short story. 
    </p><hr>
    <h2>Now, meet my husband!</h2>
    <img src="./babe.jpg" alt="Zay's husband" height="300" width="300">
    <p>This is Ayomide Yusuf, my boyfriend and husband.
        He is easily on of my favorite people in the world. He makes me happy, treats me like a queen amd will happily gives me the last money he has to be sure I'm okay.
    He likes eveything I like, even though I don't like everything he likes because he's a nerd but still. He taught me a lot about love. He's my 1 Corinthians 13:4. He redefined love for me, broke down structures 
built by my past and reformed it into a beautiful castle, standing strong in my heart despite the patches, the crooked roof and missing parts. He drew water out of himself to water the place where plants grew, nurtured it with patience and care, groomed it with all that it had despited its stubbornness to grow till it bloomed into a garden we both call beautiful.
 He'd hold my hand and pray for me, teach me about thing I didn't even know mattered. "I love you My Wife", "You're so freaking beautiful", "sent", "How much is it?", "Are you okay mama?", "Let me know if you need anything else", are undeniably his favorite things to say.
My golden retriever boy.</p>
 <p>Okay, onto things he likes, 
    <ul>
        <li>God</li>
        <li>His family</li>
        <li> Zay</li>
        <li>His Wife</li>
        <li>His Girl</li> 
        <li>uhm... me</li>
        <li>working for money to take care of his girl...I really can't think of anything else</li>
    </ul></p>
<p>Recently he wrote <a href="https://www.icloud.com/notes/019UHSebUxhvGAqdbp3xdxOxQ#300_Reasons_why_I_love_YOU" draggable="true">300 reasons why he loves me</a> and I didn't even know it was capable to have that much reason to love someone, let alone me! 
He loves me in a way that's so different, like everytime he shows me affection he srcatches an itch that has been itching him for long. In my whole life, I have never met anyone that is so eager to spend their money, both the one they have now and the one they'll have, on me with so much joy.
He has so much dreams and aspiration and I pray he achieves all of them, every single of them. He is my biggest supporter, I don't think there is anything I have told this man I want to do that he hasn't supported me, whether I'm being delusional or not. "Don't worry baby, I'll fund it" is the next thing I'll hear.

 <h2>Our Memories together! </h2>
 <p>

        <video width="320" height="320" controls>
            <source src="./beach.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <li>Our first kiss, no evidence obviously! but this was us the next morning</li>
             <img src="./b2.jpg" alt="my babe" height="230" width="230" draggable="true">
            <img src="./me.jpg" alt="me" height="230" width="230" draggable="true">
            </li>
            <li>Then there was our first outing together in Asaba, this was so much fun!</li>
              <ul>
                <li>we watched a movie together</li>
                <li>ate alot and took some videos</li>
            </ul>
        <li>THEN AUGUST 2025!!!!! oh my dayss!!</li>    
        <ul>
            <li>First up, Rodina meet up, food and yap</li>

        </ul>
        <li>To be honest, I can't fit in every memory we have into this because they're quite a handful
            but I hope they are always engraed in our hearts forever. What we are building is real indeed.
        </li>
    </ol>
 </p>

 <h2>TO MY AYOMIDE,</h2>
 <P>I love you, with all of my heart and I pray I continue doing so for the rest of my life.
    Since you forced me to do this, I decided to make it about you and I hope you love it and you're impressed.

    With all my love,
    Zay!
 </P>
